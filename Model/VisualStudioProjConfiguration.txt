UEBGrid is comprised of the following Fortran Files

snowdv.f90  Driver file with the main program.  This has the changes needed to use netcdf inputs and outputs specified in the UEBGrid interface design document
snowdgt.f90  Main UEB subroutine.  The only changes from UEBveg are to control input/output
snowxv.f90  Subroutines used for radiation calculations from vegetation UEB
canopy.f90  Subroutines for canopy parameterization from vegetation UEB (unchanged for UEB grid)
ParamSiteInitial.f90 Subroutines for reading parameters and site variables from the formats specified in the UEBGrid interface design document
inputreading.f90  Subroutines called from snowdv.f90 to read the various control files specified in the UEBGrid interface design document
Output.f90  Subroutines to write netcdf output according to the UEBGrid interface design document
functions.f90  Utility subroutines used in the wrapping of UEB to provide a grid interface
checks.f90  Additional utility subroutines
AggregatedOutput.f90   Subroutines to write aggregated output

It also needs to be linked to netCDF library files

netCDF libraries were downloaded from the following link:
ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/contrib/win32/netcdf-ifort-3.6.1.zip

To use NetCDF from Fortran
Add the following libraries to visual studio project
netcdf.lib
netcdf_f90.lib

For the bitbucket repository we leave netCDF out of the repository so need to go up a few directories

Settings to Visual studio to include netCDF files in the builds
In Fortran\General\Additional Include Directories: ...\..\netcdf3.6.1\include
In Linker\General\Additional Library Directories\General: ..\..\..\netcdf3.6.1\lib
In Linker\Input\Additional Dependencies: netcdf.lib
In code use netcdf
In system path create an entry for the path to the file netcdf.dll in ..\..\..\netcdf3.6.1\lib
[Also handy to add ...\netcdf3.6.1\bin to path to take advantage of ncdump and ncgen programs]
In Visual studio solution add netcdf.lib and netcdf_f90.lib
In Visual studio project properties -> Fortran ->Libraries set runtime library to Multithreaded to avoid libcmt warning.
