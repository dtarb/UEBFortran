This folder contains a small TW Daniels Experimental Forest test dataset from Vinod Mahat's work. As set up here the association between grid cells and physical locations is artificial and developed for testing the grid code

Larger test datasets have been assembled but file sizes (500 MB+) exceed what it seems possible to load into BitBucket, so contact the author if you want one of these.
